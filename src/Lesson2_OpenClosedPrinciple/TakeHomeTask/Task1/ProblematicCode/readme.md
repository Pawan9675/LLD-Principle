### üîç Original Design vs SOLID Principle Violation

Let's start with the original Java code that calculates discounts based on the type of product:

```java
enum ProductType {
    ELECTRONICS,
    CLOTHING;
}

class Product {
    ProductType type;
    double price;

    double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }

    ProductType getType() {
        return type;
    }
}

public class DiscountCalculator {
    public double calculateDiscount(Product product) {
        if (product.getType() == ProductType.ELECTRONICS) {
            return product.getPrice() * 0.10;
        } else if (product.getType() == ProductType.CLOTHING) {
            return product.getPrice() * 0.20;
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
```

At first glance, the above design might look clean and simple. However, **it fundamentally violates the Open-Closed Principle (OCP)** ‚Äî one of the key SOLID principles of object-oriented design.

### ‚úÖ What is the Open-Closed Principle?

> ‚ÄúA class should be open for extension but closed for modification.‚Äù

In plain words:

* You should be able to **add new features (extensions)** without changing existing code (modifications).
* Your existing, tested, and working code should remain **untouched** when new requirements come in.

---

### üö´ Problem with the Original Code

The original `DiscountCalculator` uses **explicit condition checks (`if-else`)** to determine the discount based on the product type. This leads to several issues:

* Every time a **new product type** (like `GROCERY`, `FURNITURE`, etc.) is added, the `calculateDiscount` method must be **modified**.
* This violates the **Open-Closed Principle**, because we are **modifying old code** to add new behavior.
* The method becomes **bloated** and hard to maintain.
* The logic becomes **less reusable** and more **error-prone** as the system scales.

**Example of this anti-pattern:**

```java
else if (product.getType() == ProductType.GROCERY) {
    return product.getPrice() * 0.05;
}
```

Imagine having 50 product types ‚Äî this method will end up with 50 `if-else` conditions. Messy and brittle.

### ‚úÖ How to Fix It? (OCP-Compliant Design)

To follow the **Open-Closed Principle**, we **decouple the discount logic from the `DiscountCalculator`** and move it into **separate strategy classes**, each responsible for its own logic.

This is a classic case where the **Strategy Design Pattern** is a perfect fit.

---

### üîß Refactored OCP-Friendly Design ‚Äî Step-by-Step

---

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `Product` Class (Simplified)

```java
public class Product {
    private double price;

    public Product(double price) {
        this.price = price;
    }

    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }
}
```

‚úÖ **Why is this better?**
We no longer rely on `ProductType` or any enum checks. The `Product` is now **just a data object**, with pricing logic abstracted elsewhere.

---

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `DiscountStrategy` Interface

```java
public interface DiscountStrategy {
    double calculateDiscount(Product product);
}
```

‚úÖ **Why do we need this?**
This interface acts as a **contract**. Any class that implements it must provide its own discount logic ‚Äî ensuring a **common structure** across all product discounts.

---

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Strategy Implementations for Each Product Type

```java
public class ElectronicsDiscount implements DiscountStrategy {
    @Override
    public double calculateDiscount(Product product) {
        return product.getPrice() * 0.10; // 10%
    }
}
```

```java
public class ClothingDiscount implements DiscountStrategy {
    @Override
    public double calculateDiscount(Product product) {
        return product.getPrice() * 0.20; // 20%
    }
}
```

‚úÖ **Why is this better?**

* Each product type now has its **own class** for discount logic.
* Adding a new product type (e.g., `GroceryDiscount`) means creating **one new class** ‚Äî **no existing code is touched.**

---

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ `DiscountCalculator` Class (Decoupled & Reusable)

```java
public class DiscountCalculator {
    public double calculate(Product product, DiscountStrategy strategy) {
        return strategy.calculateDiscount(product);
    }
}
```

‚úÖ **Why is this awesome?**

* No `if-else` statements.
* It only performs the **calculation**, deferring the logic to the strategy passed in.
* Clean, modular, and **fully follows OCP**.

---

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ `Main` Class ‚Äî Example Usage

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Product electronics = new Product(10000);
        Product clothing = new Product(2000);

        DiscountCalculator calculator = new DiscountCalculator();

        double eDiscount = calculator.calculate(electronics, new ElectronicsDiscount());
        double cDiscount = calculator.calculate(clothing, new ClothingDiscount());

        System.out.println("Electronics Discount: ‚Çπ" + eDiscount);
        System.out.println("Clothing Discount: ‚Çπ" + cDiscount);
    }
}
```

### üß† Final Summary (Plain English)

> **Before:**
> All discount logic was bundled into one method using if-else statements.
> Every time a new product type was added, we had to edit and risk breaking old code.

> **After:**
> Each product type now has its **own strategy class**.
> You can add new types **without modifying existing logic** ‚Äî making your code **cleaner, scalable, and SOLID-compliant**.

### Explantion:

Imagine you are building a basic discount system for a shop. You only have two types of products right now: **Electronics** and **Clothing**. So you write a class called `DiscountCalculator` that checks what type of product it is and then applies the discount. If it‚Äôs electronics, you give 10% off. If it‚Äôs clothing, you give 20% off. You do this using `if` and `else if` conditions. So far, it looks fine and works correctly. But here‚Äôs where the problem starts ‚Äî later, the business grows and more product types are added: **Grocery**, **Furniture**, **Toys**, **Books**, and so on. Now, every time you want to add a new product, you must go back to the same `DiscountCalculator` class and keep adding more `if-else` statements. The class keeps growing longer and more complex. Even worse, each time you touch this class to add something new, there is a small risk you might accidentally break some existing code. For example, a typo in the electronics logic might break all electronics discounts! This makes the code **fragile** (easy to break), **bloated** (too big and messy), and **hard to maintain**. This also means your code is **violating a very important rule in clean software design** called the **Open/Closed Principle**.

The **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** simply means that:
üß† *‚ÄúYour code should be open for extension (you should be able to add new features easily), but closed for modification (you should not have to change existing working code).‚Äù*
But in our original case, we're doing the exact opposite. We‚Äôre modifying existing code every time we add something new, which is risky and bad for long-term maintenance.

So how do we fix this?
We **restructure** the code using a better design ‚Äî we apply the idea of **strategy pattern** and interfaces. Instead of putting all the discount logic inside one class that handles all product types, we create **separate classes** for each product type, and we **let each class handle its own discount rule**. So for electronics, we create a new class called `ElectronicsDiscount`, and inside it, we write: "I provide 10% discount." For clothing, we make a `ClothingDiscount` class that says: "I provide 20% discount." Each of these classes will **implement an interface**, like `DiscountStrategy`, which defines a method called `calculateDiscount(product)`. This interface is just a **promise or contract** that says: ‚ÄúIf you want to be part of our discount system, you must have a method that calculates discount.‚Äù

Now, our main `DiscountCalculator` class becomes very clean. It **no longer decides** how much discount to apply. It just asks: ‚ÄúHey strategy, how much discount do you provide for this product?‚Äù and the strategy (e.g. ElectronicsDiscount or ClothingDiscount) gives the answer. If tomorrow, we want to add a new product type like **Grocery**, we don‚Äôt have to touch the old code at all. We simply create a new class `GroceryDiscount` that also implements `DiscountStrategy` and return 5% discount. Done! üéâ No changes to old logic, no risks of breaking anything.

This is a **perfect example of following the Open/Closed Principle**. You‚Äôre not changing existing files; you're just adding new ones. Your code is now more **modular** (each part has its own job), **easy to test**, **easy to maintain**, and **less likely to break**.
It's like giving every product type its **own little brain**, instead of relying on one big brain that handles everything. Each one knows how much discount it should give, and the main calculator doesn‚Äôt care who you are ‚Äî it just uses your logic. This makes your system very **scalable** and **clean**.
